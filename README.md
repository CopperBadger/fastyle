Chrome Extension to Restyle FurAffinity.net using Bootstrap

## Wait No Longer!
If you cry yourself to sleep at night wondering if FA is *ever*
going to update their UI, cry no more, baby! Your prayers have been
answered!

The **FAStyle** Chrome Extension restyles and enhances FurAffinity.net
with Bootstrap and jQuery so you can stay furry without staying
in the 90s. Check out some of the feautures:

## Feature Highlights

* **Infinite Scroll** for *all* galleries (front page, browse, search, personal galleries, scraps and favorites)
* **Asynchronous Actions** -- when you click "Watch" or post a comment, it happens right then and there, no page reload!
* A cleaner, sleeker, and more visual experience.
* Much more!

## Setup
Setup for FAStyle from source is super easy!

1. **Clone** or **[Download](https://github.com/CopperBadger/fastyle/archive/master.zip)** this Repo.
2. In Chrome, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
3. Enable **Developer Mode** and select **Load Unpacked Extension**.
4. Select the *directory* containing the cloned / downloaded repo.
5. The extension should appear in your list of extensions. Enable it and browse FA!

Google's introductory documentation on writing extensions is just
about all you'll have to know (aside from jQuery and Bootstrap of
course) if you want to play around with the code, and can be found
here:

* <https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts>

## Alpha Disclaimer and Warranty
FAStyle is still in development! There are still a good number of
To-Dos before the extension can be considered ready for public use,
but that doesn't mean it'll take very long. If you chose to check
out FAStyle (*and you really should!*), be prepared for a few
rough edges or otherwise untouched areas of the site.

This extension comes with no guarantee. Because it depends on the
structure of FA's markup, the extension will have to be updated
if said markup ever changes.

If you're a web developer and would like to help make / keep the
extention future-proof, please don't hesitate to ask!
